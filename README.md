# Simple C Key Logger #
*( made for fun not for actual use )*


### - Welcome everyone!
After seeing a [Daniel Hirsch](https://github.com/danieldeer) video about a key logger written in C I got inspired to try and create my own version.

Its really simple and probably there are much better ways to create a key logger in C , but this is my own way so I hope you can enjoy it!

###  - Compilation

You can use the ready to go executable

`./logger <keyboard-file-path> <path-to-save-logs>`

##### Note that all the paths you give when executing NEED no to be absolute ( starting with / root ).

### - Notes

This program works exclusively in Linux, since it uses the "Everything is a file" filosophy.

### - Creator Note
This small project was created for fun and I give all credit of inspiration to Daniel Hirsch as mentioned above. Have a good day!
